# What is MP-CodeCheck?
MPCC is a self-supervised, iterative learning, anomaly detection system for code. MPCC was designed to learn good and bad code syntax, patterns, and semantics from a large corpora of existing code. Once trained, MPCCâ€™s model can be used for a variety of tasks such as: (i) detecting potential anomalies in existing code,
(ii) grading the quality of an existing repository, and (iii) guiding programmers through the important aspects of a new code
repository, to name a few.
